## Cryptography-Algorithms

- Luhn Algorithm.
- BCH or Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem Algorithm.
- BruteForce Attack Algorithm.
- Rainbow Table Algorithm.

#### (GUI has been made for better User Interface).

**For Rainbow Table, already provided txt file with generated passwords so you can select it instead of generating.**
**Also, provided an executable file to run the program (CryptographyAlgorithms.jar).**
